 <p>Why formulas you may think, I thought that if I had to make a website it has to be helpful for something. One thing that I always struggled with is remembering formulas for test, quizzes or homework. This website is a very helpful studying tool that you could use to study formulas. Each page will have an individual consent like algebra, geometry and biology and will lay out all the formulas and how to use them.While this project was made for me to help study it will most likely help a lot of people to study or use. </p>
