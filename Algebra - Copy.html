<ul class=""><li>Y=Mx+b</li>  </ul>
<p>This is used to graph a line with M being the slope and b being the y-intercept</p><p>Ex)Y=1/2x+3</p>
<ul><li>Y-Y<sub>1</sub>=M(X-X<sub>1</sub>)</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the y-intercept given the slope with Y<sub>1</sub> being the y cordinant on a pair of points and M being the slope.</p><p>Ex)Y-7=1/4(X-4)= Y=1/4x+8</p>
<ul><li>(x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)/(y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>)</li></ul>
<p>This is used to find the slope of a line (x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>) would be two points that you subtract to get the slope, while thet are over each other you dont divide it would to get them into a slope.</p><p>Ex) (9-4)/(7-3) which would be 5/4.</p>
<ul><li>(P <sub>1</sub> P <sub>2</sub>)=<span>&#8730;</span>(X <sub>2</sub>-X<sub>1</sub>)+(Y<sub>2</sub>-Y<sub>1</sub>)</li></ul>
<p>This formulas is used to find the distance between two points, with x<sub>1</sub> being a cordiant on a graph.</p><p>Ex)(3-4)/(9-3)=-1/6</p>
<ul><li>A<sup>2</sup>+B<sup>2</sup>=C<sup>2</sup></li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the hypotenuse of a triangle. With A<sup>2</sup> being a line other than the hypotenuse.</p><p>Ex)75<sup>2</sup>+69<sup>2</sup>=101.91<sup>2</sup></p>\
<ul><li>(1/2)B x H</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the area of a triangle with B being the base and H being the height</p><p>Ex) (1/2)6 x 4=12</p>
<ul><li>W x H</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the area of a rectangle with W being the width and H being the height.</p><p>Ex) 8 x 12=96</p>
<ul><li>3.14 x r </li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the area of a circle with r being the radius and 3.14 being a simplified version of pi.</p><p>Ex) 3.14 x 13=40.82</p>
<ul><li>L x H/2</li></ul>
<p>This is used to find the formula of a rhombus with L being the length and H being the height and dividing all of it by 2.</p><p>Ex) 4 x 5/2=10</p>
<ul><li>1/2(b<sub>1</sub>+b<sub>2</sub>) x H</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the area or a trapizoid with b<sub>1</sub> being on of the bases and b<sub>2</sub> being the other and H being the height and dividing it all by 1/2.</p><p>Ex)1/2(3+7) x 5=25</p>
<ul><li>Y=Kx</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the direct variation with K being the constant and x bing the variable that you plug into.</p><p>Ex)Y=4.5x</p>
