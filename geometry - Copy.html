<ul>
<li>Sin(A)=opposite/hypotenuse</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the sine of a coner in a tringle with opposite being the side opposite to the corner and hypotenuse being the longest side in a triangle.</p><p>Ex) Sin(A)=12/4 so Sin(A)=3</p>
<ul><li>Cos(A)=adjacent/hypotenuse</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the cosine of a corner in a triangle with adjacent being the side that is not opposite or the hypotenuse and hypotenuse being the logest side on the triangle.</P><p>Ex)Cos(A)=34/8 so Cos(A)=4.25</p>
<ul><li>Tan(A)=opposite/adjacent</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the tan of a corner in atriangle with the opposite being the oposite side of the triangle and ajacent being the side touchnig the corner and not the hypotenuse.</p><p>Ex)Tan(A)=78/43 so Cos(A)=1.814</p>
<ul><li>Cosac(A)=c/a x 1/Sin(A)</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the cosac of an corner in a triangle with c being a side in the triangle and Sin(A) being the Sin(A).</p><p>Ex)Cosec(A)=24/4 x 1/4.25 so Cosec(A)=1.4118</p>
<ul><li>Sec(A)=b/c x 1/Cos(A)</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the sec of the trinagle with b and c being sides of the triangle and Cos(A) being the Cos(A).</p><p>Ex) Sec(A)=34/21 x 1/5.27 so Sec(A)=.3072</p>
<ul><li>Cot(A)=b/a x 1/Tan(A)</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the cot of a corner in a triangle with b and a being the sides of the triangle and Tan(A) being the Tan(A).</p><p>Ex) Cot(A)=23/14 x 1/5.89 so Cot(A)=35/14 x 1/2.09=5.225</p>
<ul><li>SA= 2(L x W + H x W + H x L)</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the surface area of a rerctangle with H being the height and L being the lenght and W being the width.</p><p>Ex) SA=2(3 x 4 + 6 x 4 + 6 x 3)=54</p>
<ul><li>SA= 4 x 3.14 x r<sup>2</sup></li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the surface area of a circle with r<sup>2</sup> being the radius of the circle and 3.14 being pi.</p> <p>Ex) SA= 4 x 3.14 x 34<sup>2</sup></p>
<ul><li>SA= 1/2(B x H)</li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the surface area of a triangle with B being the the base and H being the height.</p><p>Ex)1/2(10 x 4)=20</p>
<ul><li>SA= 2(3.14) x r x h + 2(3.14) x r<sup>2</sup></li></ul>
<p>This formula is used to find the surface area of a cylinder with 3.14 being pi and r being the radius of the circle face and h being the height.</p><p>Ex) SA= 2(3.14) x 4 x 7 + 2(3.14) x 4<sup>2</sup>=276.32</p>
